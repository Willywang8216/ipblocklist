To automatically sync a forked repository every hour, the method depends on the platform you are using (GitHub, GitLab, etc.). For GitHub, the most reliable way to enforce an hourly schedule is by using **GitHub Actions** with a cron job.

### Method 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended for GitHub)
You can create a workflow file in your repository that triggers a sync operation every hour using a cron schedule.

1.  **Create a Workflow File**: In your forked repository, create a new file at `.github/workflows/sync.yml`.
2.  **Add the Configuration**: Paste the following code, which uses the `Fork-Sync-With-Upstream-action`. This example sets the schedule to run at the top of every hour (`0 * * * *`).

```yaml
name: Hourly Sync with Upstream

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *' # Runs every hour
  workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering

jobs:
  sync_with_upstream:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Sync main with upstream latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository
      - name: Checkout target branch
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: main  # Replace with your default branch name (e.g., master)

      # Step 2: Run the sync action
      - name: Sync Upstream
        uses: aormsby/Fork-Sync-With-Upstream-action@v3.4
        with:
          upstream_sync_repo: owner/upstream-repo # Replace with the original repo (e.g., facebook/react)
          upstream_sync_branch: main # Replace with the original repo's branch
          target_sync_branch: main   # Replace with your fork's branch
          target_repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Automatically generated token
          test_mode: false
```

### Method 2: GitHub Apps (Easier Setup)
If you prefer a "set-and-forget" solution without writing code, you can install a GitHub App.
*   **Pull App**: There is a popular app called "Pull" (often found as `wei/pull`) that you can install on your repository. It automatically syncs the default branch of your fork with the upstream repository. While you cannot strictly define the "every hour" rule (it typically runs based on events or its own internal schedule), it effectively keeps the repo synchronized automatically.

### Method 3: GitLab (Built-in Feature)
If your repository is hosted on GitLab, this functionality is built-in.
*   **Repository Mirroring**: GitLab's "Pull Mirroring" feature automatically updates your fork from the upstream repository. By default, this method updates your fork **once per hour**, requiring no manual script or configuration files. You can enable this under **Settings > Repository > Mirroring repositories**.
